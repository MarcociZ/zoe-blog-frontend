but it contains fully implemented registration and login page for scaling purposes. Some parts are implemented only in frontend like tags, comments, tabs.

## Technologies being used for frontend:

- `Redux Toolkit` - global state management is responsible for authorization imlementation, posts storage, tags etc.

- `React Hook Form` - for login and registration <form>

- `React Router v6` - is responsible for web navigation

- `React markdown / Simple Editor` -makes post look nice and grammatically correct

- `Axios` - for impelementing queries to backend
